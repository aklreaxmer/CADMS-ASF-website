			<p style="clear:both;"><br>Internationally recognized as one of the premier research and educational institutions for health sciences in the world, the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine (SVM) offers outstanding training opportunities for junior research scientists whose career goals are research, public service, and clinical and academic education. Key, high profile programs at UCD that support student and faculty research include the new One Health Institute, the Genome Center, the department in Wildlife, Fisheries, and Conservation Biology, the Center for Animal Health and Food Safety, the Center for Animal Disease Modeling and Surveillance (CADMS), Center for Laboratory Animal Science, the Center for Vector borne Diseases and clinical facilities in the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital and UCD Medical Center.

			<p>The Center for Animal Disease Modeling and Surveillance (CADMS), a part of the SVM Department of Veterinary Medicine and Epidemiology, was established in 2004 to provide a coordinated, multidisciplinary, on-going research effort to develop models and modeling systems in the area of animal disease. Currently, CADMS is directed by Dr Martinez-Lopez and is the FAO Reference Center for modeling and epidemiology.  The Center has approximately 18 personnel including faculty, analysts, programmers, veterinarians, administrative staff, graduate students, and undergraduate students from 10 countries. The center’s overarching goal is to develop systems that can be used to prevent, control, or eradicate diseases and their associated adverse economic impacts and to serve as a core research program to provide a focus for all faculty interested in disease modeling (including mathematical and simulation modeling and risk analysis) and surveillance research.

CIRAD is present in more than 90 countries with twelve regional offices and has a global network of partners. CIRAD bases its operation on development needs, from field to laboratory and from a local to global scale. Its activities involve life sciences, social sciences and engineering sciences applied to agriculture, food, natural resource management and society. Researchers from two units from CIRAD will be involved in this project: AGIRs and CMAEE.

			<p>AGIRs unit (Animal and Integrated Risk Management) develops research on analyses and management of sanitary risks which make communities, societies or agro-ecosystems more fragile. The range of expertise goes from analytic to evaluative epidemiology, social sciences (socio-economic issues) and simulation, modeling.</p>

			<p>CMAEE unit (Control of Exotic and Emerging Animal Diseases) is specialized in studying host-vector-pathogen interactions. It has been developing virology researches on ASFV for 10 years and has recently acquired the competence in soft tick rearing and the expertise on tick ecology by creating a section dedicated to arthropod vectors. It is in charge of BL-3 laboratories and BL-2 insectaries that will allow to conduct the necessary experimental studies proposed in this project.
